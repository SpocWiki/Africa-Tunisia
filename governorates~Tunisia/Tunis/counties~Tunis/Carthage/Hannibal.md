> **Hannibal** (; Punic: 𐤇𐤍𐤁𐤏𐤋, romanized: Ḥanībaʿl; 247 – between 183 and 181 BC) 
> was a Carthaginian general and statesman 
> who commanded the forces of Carthage in their battle against the Roman Republic 
> during the Second Punic War.
>
> Hannibal's father, Hamilcar Barca, 
> was a leading Carthaginian general during the First Punic War. 
> His younger brothers were Mago and Hasdrubal; 
> his brother-in-law was Hasdrubal the Fair, who commanded other Carthaginian armies. 
> 
> Hannibal lived during a period of great tension in the Mediterranean Basin, 
> triggered by the emergence of the Roman Republic as a great power 
> with its defeat of Carthage in the First Punic War. 
> Revanchism prevailed in Carthage, symbolized by 
> the pledge that Hannibal made to his father to "never be a friend of Rome".
>
> In 218 BC, Hannibal attacked Saguntum (modern Sagunto, Spain), 
> an ally of Rome, in Hispania, sparking the Second Punic War. 
> 
> Hannibal invaded Italy by crossing the Alps with North African war elephants. 
> In his first few years in Italy, as the leader of a Carthaginian and partially Celtic army, 
> he won a succession of victories at the Battle of Ticinus, Trebia, Lake Trasimene, 
> and Cannae, inflicting heavy losses on the Romans. 
> 
> Hannibal was distinguished for his ability to 
> determine both his and his opponent's respective strengths and weaknesses, 
> and to plan battles accordingly. 
> 
> His well-planned strategies allowed him to conquer and ally with several Italian cities 
> that were previously allied to Rome. 
> 
> Hannibal occupied most of southern Italy for 15 years. 
> The Romans, led by Fabius Maximus, avoided directly engaging  him, 
> instead waging a war of attrition (the Fabian strategy). 
> 
> Carthaginian defeats in Hispania prevented Hannibal from being reinforced, 
> and he was unable to win a decisive victory. 
> A counter-invasion of North Africa, led by the Roman general Scipio Africanus, 
> forced him to return to Carthage. 
> Hannibal was eventually defeated at the Battle of Zama, ending the war in a Roman victory.
>
> After the war, Hannibal successfully ran for the office of sufet. 
> He enacted political and financial reforms 
> to enable the payment of the war indemnity imposed by Rome. 
> 
> Those reforms were unpopular with members of the Carthaginian aristocracy and in Rome, 
> and he fled into voluntary exile. 
> 
> During this time, he lived at the Seleucid court, 
> where he acted as military advisor to Antiochus III the Great in his war against Rome. 
> Antiochus met defeat at the Battle of Magnesia and was forced to accept Rome's terms, 
> and Hannibal fled again, making a stop in the Kingdom of Armenia. 
> His flight ended in the court of Bithynia. 
> He was betrayed to the Romans and committed suicide by poisoning himself.
>
> Hannibal is considered 
> one of the greatest military tacticians and generals of Western antiquity, 
> alongside Alexander the Great, Cyrus the Great, Julius Caesar, Scipio Africanus, and Pyrrhus. 
> According to Plutarch, Scipio asked Hannibal "who the greatest general was", 
> to which Hannibal replied "either Alexander or Pyrrhus, then myself".
